> ### What is Graph ?

    Graphs in data structures are non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them. Graphs in data structures are used to address real-world problems in which it represents the problem area as a network like telephone networks, circuit networks, and social networks.

> ### Why Graph Algorithms are Important ?
    Graphs are very useful data structures which can be to model various problems. These algorithms have direct applications on Social Networking sites, State Machine modeling and many more
